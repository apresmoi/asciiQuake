# asciiQuake 👹

A port of id Software's [Quake](https://github.com/id-software/quake) that renders BSP worlds as ASCII text through [GlyphCSS](https://glyphcss.com/), without a WebGL or canvas renderer. asciiQuake preprocesses original Quake data into browser-ready JSON, image assets, and render bundles, then runs the game in TypeScript.

asciiQuake is a fork of [cssQuake](https://github.com/LayoutitStudio/cssQuake), created by [Layoutit](https://layoutit.com/), which renders the same world as real HTML/CSS 3D geometry through [PolyCSS](https://github.com/LayoutitStudio/polycss). This fork swaps the renderer for GlyphCSS: the world is painted as a grid of coloured characters instead of DOM polygons. PolyCSS is still the engine underneath — it owns game logic, camera, controls, and collision — while the ASCII output is composited over its render. Press `V` in-game to cycle between the two backends.

## How to Play

Install dependencies and generate the Quake assets once. Set either `QUAKE_SHAREWARE_URL` for the Quake 1.06 shareware archive, or `QUAKE_PAK_PATH` for a local `pak0.pak`:

```sh
pnpm install
export QUAKE_SHAREWARE_URL="<Quake 1.06 shareware zip URL>"
# or: export QUAKE_PAK_PATH=".local/quake/pak0.pak"
pnpm prepare:quake
```

After the assets exist, run the local dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm build` only builds the Vite app. Use `pnpm build:full` when you want to regenerate Quake assets and build the app in one command.

## How It Works

asciiQuake keeps cssQuake's [PolyCSS](https://github.com/LayoutitStudio/polycss) foundation and adds a [GlyphCSS](https://glyphcss.com/) rendering backend on top of it.

PolyCSS turns Quake geometry into real HTML elements: world faces are positioned with CSS `matrix3d(...)` transforms, textured with pixelated CSS backgrounds, and grouped into meshes instead of being drawn on a `<canvas>`. It still drives the game loop, camera, controls, and collision in both render modes.

GlyphCSS is the default renderer. It takes the same world geometry, rasterizes it to a character grid, and paints it into a `<pre>` element — one text node per frame, with colour carried by a COLR/CPAL colour-font atlas rather than a `<span>` per run. `?renderMode=polycss` selects the original DOM renderer instead.

`src/App.ts` loads generated map/model JSON from `/q` and mounts prebuilt PolyCSS render bundles. Gameplay systems connect rendered surfaces back to visibility, lightstyles, doors, buttons, brush-model movement, pickups, hazards, weapon feedback, HUD/menu state, and level transitions.

The browser does not parse the original PAK or BSP files while the game is running. Generated game assets are intentionally ignored by Git.

## Build and Runtime

asciiQuake splits Quake-like behavior between prepared source-backed facts and a TypeScript-owned runtime.

`src/prepare/assets.mjs` downloads the Quake 1.06 shareware archive from `QUAKE_SHAREWARE_URL`, verifies the extracted `resource.1`, extracts `ID1/PAK0.PAK`, and writes browser-ready assets under the ignored `build/generated/public/q` folder.

The prepare step parses original BSP, WAD, MDL, LMP, entity, visibility, collision, HUD, menu, pickup, weapon, and QuakeC-derived gameplay data. Textures are decoded through the Quake palette into PNG assets, animated texture sequences become CSS animation inputs, and episode maps get prebuilt PolyCSS render bundles so the browser can attach prepared world DOM instead of rebuilding every surface at startup.

The runtime is not a Quake VM. TypeScript owns the browser game loop, player movement, collision response, enemy state, pickups, weapons, UI, audio, routing, debug hooks, and PolyCSS DOM updates. When asciiQuake needs a more faithful behavior, the default is to add a prepared fact from the original source material first, then consume it through explicit TypeScript systems.

## URL API

asciiQuake keeps its shareable game state in small, Quake-native URL parameters. `map=e1m1` opens a map directly, and `view=x,y,z,pitch,yaw,roll` places the player at a Quake-style pose: origin in Quake units, with pitch, yaw, and roll in degrees.

```text
https://asciiquake.wtf/?map=e1m1&view=480,-192,72,0,90,0
```

This makes a URL behave like a lightweight console command for reproducing bugs, sharing exact views, capturing screenshots, and comparing asciiQuake against native Quake tools such as vkQuake. Roll must currently be zero because asciiQuake does not render camera roll yet.

Developer-oriented params such as `debugPolys=1`, `debugFly=1`, `debugPointer=1`, `perspective=...`, and `zoom=...` are kept separate from the core route so debug sessions can be reproduced without turning the URL API into a save system.

## Embedding

asciiQuake can run inside an iframe. Add `relayKeys=1` if the parent page wants filtered gameplay key events from the focused game iframe:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://asciiquake.wtf/?relayKeys=1"
  allow="pointer-lock; fullscreen"
  referrerpolicy="origin"
></iframe>
```

When enabled, asciiQuake posts `cssquake:key` messages for gameplay keys only. Parent pages should validate `event.origin` before reading them. Using `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` disables the relay because asciiQuake will not have a parent origin to target.

## License

asciiQuake source code is [GPL-2.0-only](LICENSE). Original Quake game data is not included in this repository; the prepare step reads shareware or local PAK input and writes ignored generated assets for local or deployed use.
